## Motivation

As a group of Bootcamp students trying to learn Full Stack coding from the ground up,
one of the hardest and most time-consuming obstacles is finding resources and tutorials that aid in the learning process.


## UserStory

- This application aims to help us and others who are interested in finding resources on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and Express.js in a more streamlined fashion. 
- Time is valuable, and running into brick walls while researching and learning to code makes learning very difficult. We hope this site makes it easier and less frustrating to learn. 

## Instructions

- Once a new user has created an account, or has an account, and is logged in at the HOME page  https://bootcamp-buddy.onrender.com , they will be redirected to the Subjects page and will be able to select different subjects, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript etc. Once the user has selected a subject, there will be various links and documents that refer to that subject.
